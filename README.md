**Moxie Protocol Improvement Proposals (MIPs)** describe standards for the Moxie Protocol , including:

- core protocol specification
- client APIs
- contract standards
- governance operations
- and more

## **Contributing**

1. Review MIP-0.
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your MIP to your fork of the repository. There is a template MIP [here](./mip-X.md).
4. Submit a Pull Request to [MIPs repository](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/MIPS/pulls).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final MIP. It must meet the formatting criteria. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new MIP and assign it a number before merging it. 

If your MIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that MIP as follow: `assets/mip-X` (for mip **X**). When linking to an image in the MIP, use relative links such as `../assets/mip-X/image.png`.

When you believe your MIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase, you should ask to have your issue added to the next dev call where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future protocol upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the MIP editors will update the state of your MIP to 'Approved'.
